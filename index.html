        <p>Located in the city downtown area, Confederation Park is one of the city’s key venues for a variety of events, including the Winterlude ice sculptures, much of Ottawa Canada Day celebrations and the Ottawa International Jazz Festival held every summer. </p>
        <p>Across on the north side of the Rideau River is Brewer Park, a popular area for students of nearby Carleton University. The centerpiece of the park is its impressive pool and arena area, which are used seasonally for outdoor swimming as well as hockey games and skating.</p>
        <p>Another of the city riverside parks is Andrew Haydon Park on the edge of the Ottawa River. Often overlooked in favor of others, this park is a great hidden gem for many recreational activities thanks to its lush biking trails and dog-friendly open spaces. There is also a bandstand located in the park, which is often used during the summer for outdoor concerts.</p>
